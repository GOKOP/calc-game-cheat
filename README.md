This is a very simple cheat for a nice mobile game called Calculator: The Game.
To use, edit top section of the source file (problem definition) to fit the level you're trying to cheat.
Then, compile or otherwise run the program. It only uses base.
The program will print all possible paths that lead to the correct result.
There might me some unsupported operations, because I haven't completed the game.
Of course I could just force through it using this very cheat, but where's the fun in that?

### Why no real interface?

This way was Convenient Enough â„¢ for me
